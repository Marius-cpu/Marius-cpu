**About me:**<br/>
My name is Marius<br/>
I'm 14<br/>

I'm mainly a ![java](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KSnus.gif) kid.   
I have a website: [gameJet](https://games.gameJet.repl.co). Even though it's
quite primitive, i'm working on it.
Started coding 2~3 years ago with Batch scripts and stuff, then moved on to Java.
I touch game development but nothing paid off .. yet.
